# Workflow

The goal of a deep learning experiment is to find one or more model candidates that meet a given performance expectation. Talos makes this process as easy and streamlined as possible. Talos provides an intuitive API to manage both semi-automated and fully-automated deep learning workflows. The below example highlights a typical semi-automated workflow from idea to production ready model.
