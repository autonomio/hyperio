## What we do?

Keep pushing the boundaries of automated deep learning workflows. Start where everyone else stops. Do it with tender loving care.

## Why we do it?

So that more people would have access to the undiluted potential and power of advanced deep learning. So that those who already have access, would feel less pain and instead have more joy.

## Who we do it for?

"Researchers first" drives Talos development. Everything is done for researchers, by researchers.
